Question 1:
Write a program that calculates and prints the value according to the given formula:
Q = Square root of [(2 * C * D)/H]
Following are the fixed values of C and H:
C is 50. H is 30.
D is the variable whose values should be input to your program in a comma-separated
sequence.
Example
Let us assume the following comma separated input sequence is given to the program:
100,150,180
The output of the program should be:
18,22,24

Question 2:
Write a program which takes 2 digits, X,Y as input and generates a 2-dimensional array. The
element value in the i-th row and j-th column of the array should be i*j.
Note: i=0,1.., X-1; j=0,1,Â¡Y-1.
Example
Suppose the following inputs are given to the program:
3,5
Then, the output of the program should be:
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]]

Question 3:
Write a program that accepts a comma separated sequence of words as input and prints the
words in a comma-separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
without,hello,bag,world
Then, the output should be:
bag,hello,without,world

Question 4:
Write a program that accepts a sequence of whitespace separated words as input and prints
the words after removing all duplicate words and sorting them alphanumerically.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
hello world and practice makes perfect and hello world again
Then, the output should be:
again and hello makes perfect practice world

Question 5:
Write a program that accepts a sentence and calculate the number of letters and digits.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
hello world! 123
Then, the output should be:
LETTERS 10

DIGITS 3

Question 6:
A website requires the users to input username and password to register. Write a program to
check the validity of password input by users.
Following are the criteria for checking the password:
1. At least 1 letter between [a-z]
2. At least 1 number between [0-9]
1. At least 1 letter between [A-Z]
3. At least 1 character from [$#@]
4. Minimum length of transaction password: 6
5. Maximum length of transaction password: 12
Your program should accept a sequence of comma separated passwords and will check them
according to the above criteria. Passwords that match the criteria are to be printed, each
separated by a comma.
Example
If the following passwords are given as input to the program:
ABd1234@1,a F1#,2w3E*,2We3345
Then, the output of the program should be:
ABd1234@1

**PythonBasicProgramming_14**

Question 1:
Define a class with a generator which can iterate the numbers, which are divisible by
7, between a given range 0 and n.

Question 2:
Write a program to compute the frequency of the words from the input. The output
should output after sorting the key alphanumerically.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
New to Python or choosing between Python 2 and Python 3? Read Python 2 or
Python 3.
Then, the output should be:
2:2
3.:1
3?:1
New:1
Python:5
Read:1
and:1
between:1
choosing:1
or:2
to:1

Question 3:

Define a class Person and its two child classes: Male and Female. All classes have a
method &quot;getGender&quot; which can print &quot;Male&quot; for Male class and &quot;Female&quot; for Female
class.

Question 4:
Please write a program to generate all sentences where subject is in [&quot;I&quot;, &quot;You&quot;] and
verb is in [&quot;Play&quot;, &quot;Love&quot;] and the object is in [&quot;Hockey&quot;,&quot;Football&quot;].

Question 5:
Please write a program to compress and decompress the string &quot;hello world!hello
world!hello world!hello world!&quot;.

Question 6:
Please write a binary search function which searches an item in a sorted list. The
function should return the index of element to be searched in the list.
